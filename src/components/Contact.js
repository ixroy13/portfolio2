            I'm glad you've found this place, but to the point. My goal is to
            make projects as user friendly as possible. In my carrer goals I
            want to master my frontend knowlage and after that develop my skills
            in backend or AI. Right now I started to learn React and in the near
            future I'm going to know some Bootstrap basic.
